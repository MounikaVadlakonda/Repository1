    <h3><b> <u>NEW DELHI</u></b></h3>
    <p> The Aam Asdmi Party (AAP)and the Bharatiya Janatha Party(BJP) on Sunday accused each other of manipukating the Delhi electroral roll in an attempt to win the Assembly election due to be held in February.</p>
    <p> Terming it as "Operation Lotus", AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the BJP had officially sought the removal of names of over 11,000 votes in Shahdara assembly segment. "We won the assembly seat last time by a margin of 5,000 votes</p>

    <p> If these 11,000 names were struck off, there would be no chance for a win this time. But they were caught red-handed and those names were not deleted. We are thankful to the Chief Election Officer for stopping this," he said</p>
    <p> The BJP, however, accused the AAP of getting fake voters' names added to the list to bolster. State BJP chief said the number of voters in Delhi saw a huge jump between the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and the assembly</p>
    <p>The same, he said, was observed after the 2019 general election. "Who got these new voters? There are no answers. They are trying to play the same game this time. BJP is saying those who don't live in Delhi anymore, those who have died why should their names be on the list?" Kejriwal alleged that BJP had launched "Operation Lotus" in the New Delhi constituency,"In 15 days, they have put in applications to delete the names of 5,000 voters and also the addition of 7,500 names to the voter list.</p>
