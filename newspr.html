       <h2> but wind, sun aid city</h2>
    <p id="id1"> The national capital witnessed the unfettered use of firecrackers across the city on Diwali, but the city was spared the toxic aftermath of flagrant violations as strong winds washed away much of the pollitants that choked the city's air on Monday evening. The air quality(AQI) reading was marginally better on the day after diwali - a first since the sstem was started in 2015- dropping from 312 kon mondat to 303 on Tuesday.</p>
